This app is all aboit creating the flashcards for learning language purposes, for example a user has to log in first of all, or register his account, if not they will not be able to create their own cards. Then, once it is done, the user can create, update or delete their cards. The card would include the word or phrase itself, the translation, the example sentence, the topic, the level of difficulty and so on. The dependencies you have to install is: npm install express ejs body-parser nodemon jsonwebtoken bcrypt dotenv cookie-parser express-ejs-layouts. The project structure is almost the same as was recommended in coursework description, with controllers, services and routes, views and public folder for static files.
